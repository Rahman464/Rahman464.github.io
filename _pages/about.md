Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Penn State, specializing in defect dynamics in radiation-damaged materials and wide-bandgap semiconductors. My research focuses on low-temperature annealing using Electron Wind Force (EWF) to restore device performance and microstructural integrity in advanced materials.
